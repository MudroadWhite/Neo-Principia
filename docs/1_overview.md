## What is Principia Mathematica?
Wiki's entry of [History of type theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_type_theory) says Principia is a *ramified theory of types*. This gives us the impression that Principia is a big type system, familiar to most of the functional programmers. At the moment, the only formalization of ramified theory of types I can find on GitHub is [written by Randall Holmes](https://github.com/Randall-Holmes/Randall-Holmes.github.io/tree/master/RTT).

We also have a type system, defaulted by most people, in Rocq. Propositions are elements of sets, functions are modeled with lambda calculus. The most significant one: by the noted CH correspondence, everything are either types or elements under types. These "common sense" fail in Principia. Propositions are not types. Sometimes for brevity propositions are untyped. The inference is performed by rewriting on propositions, not on types. Type plays a much more auxiliary role, and Principia which embodies ramified theory of types, is actually a rewriting system.

## What is the value of this project?
Proposing Principia Mathematica is a matter of theory, and verifying such a theory is a matter of application. This project aims to be a scythe to demystify a decaded myth. This project wraps up ideas in the book, writes down, organizes and iterates like a software product. This project is a small world to communicate, between math, philosophy and computer science people.

This project shows the power of type-theory-based modern formal verifiers, with only mediocre technology being used. This project uses Rocq like a bag of pitons to [sculpt a better checkpoint](https://x.com/jdlichtman/status/2015174938865655950) for participants to craft, and exhibits an automated PM with as minimal Rocq tactics as possible. It is to be detected bugs easily, modified easily, executed with controlled automation, and maybe built on with better abstractions. It saves you the time to buy a physical copy of the book, flip the pages with anxiety and boredom just to grind every line of proofs written in a [ruthless massive tomb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUFiQV30eM) that appears in your dream and drags your hair into a mess every night. This project can inspire indie gamedevs whose core goal is making mediocre ideas into games; the flood of Principia Mathematica jokes therefore continues on X.

This is a project where you can read and write the code line by line.

## Who did what
All of chapter 1 - 5 are directly attributed to [Landon's formalization of Principia](https://github.com/LogicalAtomist/principia).

I started this project by
- [x] Making chapter 1 - 5 of Landon's original repository into a Rocq project
- [x] Simplifying `Nicod1_4.v`, `Yuelin.v`, `Jorgensen3_47.v`, `Lemma5_7.v`, cutting down 20% of their LoC and greatly enhance readability
- [x] Simplifying, bug-picking chapter 1 - 5, cutting down \~1k LoC in total
- [x] Redesigning custom `Ltac`s in chapter 1 - 5 to their perfection, eliminating all incorrect `Ltac` usages once and for all, plus cleanups like `clear`/`move` that were once necessary

## Project status
We are building: 
- [x] Chapter 9 - A demonstration set of theorems to show chapter 1 - 5 can be extended to quantified propositions(with single "apparent variable"). Basic demonstration for a predicate called "IsSameType". Support for instantiating individuals.
- [x] Chapter 10 - The real and practical alternative to chapter 9, being used in later chapters. Material implications converted to formal implications. Notation supports for `→` and `↔` with single apparent variable.
- [x] Chapter 11 - Quantified propositions extended to more than one variables. Similarly, extended notation supports for `→` and `↔`.
- [x] Chapter 12 - Axiom of reducibility, and its conceptual support, the `Order` type.
- [x] Chapter 13 - Propositional equality(different from definitional equality). Support for instantiating predicative functions. 
- [x] Chapter 14 - Notation `ι` of the descriptions. Theorems on them.
- [ ] \[WIP\]Chapter 20 - Notation on class, and theorems of classes.

### Milestones
**Ongoing: Finish chapter 20**  I believe that implementing classes and relations should symbolize the availability to express everything in Principia. Implementing class should be a very important feature, and maybe eliminate all technical difficulties for PM symbol definitions once and for all.

I'm also plan to stop working on this once chapter 20 has been completely translated, because I want to use my time on better things

**2026.02:** Chapter 14, the first chapter with an *incomplete/context based* symbol(the description), has been finished. Finishing these chapters involves both new context for theorems to be assumed, and more complicated symbols to be defined. Also, we have finished the complete documentation from chapter 1 to 14. This project has been mature enough to be examined by everyone, and viewers should find it way easier to comprehend and participate into criticisms towards Principia.

**2025.10:** Chapter 9, the first chapter after chapter 5, has been finished. Chapter 9's theorems has a whole new context to be interpreted, so designing a new way to prove the theorems, in contrast to chapter 1 - 5, is required. Completion of this chapter involves a lot of mind works and deprecated experiments. Also, "New Principia" has been renamed into "Neo Principia".

**2025.9:** New Principia, this project, has been started and established. We have set up a workable environment for Landon's project and successfully compiled everything in chapter 1 - 5.
